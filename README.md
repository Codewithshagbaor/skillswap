# SkillSwap

SkillSwap is a decentralized platform that allows users to upload, purchase, and exchange skills and courses using blockchain technology.

## Integration with Flow

SkillSwap integrates with the Flow blockchain to manage and verify skill transactions. We use smart contracts deployed on the Flow EVM Testnet to handle skill uploads, purchases, and ownership verification. The integration is achieved using the 

ethers.js

 library to interact with the smart contracts and WalletConnect for mobile wallet support.
